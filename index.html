    <h4> About Me </h4>
    <p>
      My passion for software engineering stems from my love for challenges. I've worked in many positions that have lacked to chellenge me mentally and that is when I decided to pursue a career in software engineering. Studying part-time while working was not enough for me, and in May of 2017, I quit my job to study full-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      My current experience includes building full stack applications with React, Redux, and Angular 2 for the front-end; along with Node+Express with SQL or NoSQl databases for the back-end.
